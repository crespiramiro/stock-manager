Product Management (CRUD): Allows users to create, read, update, and delete products. Each product is associated with a user through the userId property.
Data Visualization: Utilizes Shadcn charts for visualizing product information such as category distribution and average prices.
Error Handling: Redirects to the authentication page upon authentication errors. Uses refresh tokens to handle token expiration.
